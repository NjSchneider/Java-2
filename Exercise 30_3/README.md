# Exercise 30_3

the goal was to rewrite Listing 15.13 using a thread to animate a flag being
raised. I was then instructed to compare the program with Listing 15.13 by 
setting the delay time to 10 in both programs and determine which one is the
faster of the two.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When analyzing the project I turned to Listing 15.3 and chapter 30 to figure out the design of the program.

### Design

I designed the program by implementing threads into Listing15_3.

### Testing

Once everything was written I ran it, but do not see a difference, so I do not know If I have written correct
code or not.

## Notes

I don't believe I was able to get it to properly run.
