# Exercise 16.13

The purpose of the program is to take the user's loan info and display the monthly and total payments with interests rates ranging from 5.00 to 8.00.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

When first looking at the assignment I decided to use the equations from  the given exercise and some of the code I used in Exercise 16.6.

### Design

I used the concepts from the last assignment and the given equations to create a program that took user input in the form of texts boxes to print the Interest Rates, Monthly Payments, and the Total Payments.

### Testing

Testing for this project was difficult to do without the entire program being complete. Once it was complete I adjusted the output in the TextArea until I was happy with how it was presented.
