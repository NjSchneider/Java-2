# Exam 2 Hands-On

This is my Exam 2 Hands-On portion. It allows the user to convert any US Dollar amount
and convert it to Canadian Dollars using the current exchange rate. 1.34 Canadian dollars
to 1 US Dollar.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When designing the program I decided to use two Text Fields, having one with editing disabled.
I then decided that a GridPane would be the best way to fill the scene.

### Design

I started by creating text fields for each Dollar amount and disabling editing of the Canadian Dollars TextField.
Then I created a Button to use to start the conversion. All of this was then put into a GridPane that was then used
to fill the scene.

### Testing

The only way I was able to properly test the program was by fully writing it and then testing it as a whole. 
The program worked on the first test.
