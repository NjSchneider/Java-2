# Exercise 16.6

The purpose of the project was to create a JavaFX program that changed the properties of a text field dynamically. 

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

The exercise was to write a program that sets the horizontal-alignment and column-size properties of a text field dynamically.
I used the code from class as a reference and decided to do some research within the book in order to get an even better understanding
of the code involved. I found an easier way to set the action event of the radio buttons than the one in class and implemented that.

### Design

I designed my program just as the ones in Listing16_2 through Listing16_4 were set up.

### Testing

After I added the radio buttons, I tested the program to see if it functioned.
When it functioned, I then added the VBox and tested to see if the textfield's size changed.
